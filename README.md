Matlab code for laterally-loaded pile group analysis

For the discription of the codes, please contact me via email.

The uploaded codes import PLAXIS 3D force displacement data of pile groups and generate p-y curves and p-multiplier.

q_from_M_v7_VolumePile.m is main script and the others are functions for this script.
